New feature: drink ratings.

"Bob wants to know if he should go to a party. He checks the average drink
rating to see if the alcohol is up to his standards. After seeing that the
average rating is 1.5 stars, he determines the party is for getting drunk,
and not for casually consuming alcohol with friends."

Each Recipe will have an additional attribute, rating.  There will also be
the ability to create a Party, which consists of Recipes.  A Party will have
a Drink Rating which will consist of the average of all Recipes assigned to
the Party.

Future Work: If this system were to support users, then individuals could
rate Recipes.  A Recipe's rating would then be the average of all user
ratings for that Recipe.  A Party's Drink Rating would then be the average
of the average Recipe ratings.

db functions will be added to store, retrieve, and calculate Recipe and
Party ratings.  The Recipe form will include a drop-down of numbers 1-5 for
drink ratings.  It should be possible to fetch a Recipe or Party rating
using JSON-RPC.
